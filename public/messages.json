They are what make Artshack a special place and are some of the most beautiful, passionate, and insightful individuals I have ever met. I quit and moved away from New York at the end of last year. Unfortunately, the current state of affairs at Artshack does not come as a surprise. I worked at Artshack for four years and watched it go through many changes as it took on growth at an incredibly rapid pace. With each new renovation and expansion the continuous, heightened sense of urgency and overall feeling of tension also grew. I believe it is essential for Artshack, those in charge in harmony with the community, to revisit the mission and remember the goal - to make ceramic arts more accessible to people of all abilities and ages. As an anti-racist, queer-affirming organization, it is the responsibility of the Executive Director and the Board to create a space where staff, teachers, and the broader community feel safe, seen, and heard. Open and transparent discourse is essential.\n\nI stand in solidarity with my Artshack family and community.",

Not only is that wrong, but it also won't work. At my office, staff became so incensed that we unionized. At the same time, we called out racism publicly and our organization had a huge public relations crisis. The board brought in an outside ED.

Given the outrageous hikes in pricing, my lived experience in the space (in which I often felt priced-out or unwelcomed, especially by the owner), and the recorded incidents in the Proton Drive, its clear to me that Artshack has completely fallen flat on it’s mission and a change in leadership is necessary.",

Embodying anti-racism is a consistent, active practice, one that is at odds with the mainstream white supremacist capitalistic forces that the US was quite literally founded upon. I think often of Ta-Nehisi Coates' statement from his book Between the World and Me: \"If you grow up in the US, you live and breathe racism.\" The work of dismantling white supremacy is like swimming upstream in a river -  it requires active work. It is active work that is crucial for our collective healing from the wounds and violent legacies of enslavement that exist in the bedrock of this country. \n\nI'm not a member of the Artshack community directly, but I am an artist living in Brooklyn, an organizer, an educator, and a person working to align my life with collective liberation. I am a white person living on unceded Lenape land, living and working in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods undergoing the current violent displacement of Black, brown and indigenous residents. I'm interested in facing this reality, and working each day, in community with others, to get creative about what true solidarity and reparations must look like in order for us to be in right relationship to each other and this land.\n\nI truly hope the Board of Artshack can set aside their egos and receive this community response to the recent chain of events for what it is: a gift. Being held accountable to something - receiving criticism that you are not doing what you said you would do, or that somewhere along the way, you went off track, or that what you are doing is causing harm - is valuable feedback, rooted in care, and should be treated as such. I hope the Artshack community can strengthen from this experience, and move towards a true embodiment of their stated values. We need art spaces that are TRULY anti-racist, TRULY queer-affirming, TRULY celebrating people of all abilities. None of these exist without the others.",

The lack of conversation, let alone collaboration, with concerned members of the community is alarming about any leadership.
